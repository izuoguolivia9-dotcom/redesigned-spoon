# Technical Writing Portfolio- Olivia Izuogu

## Overview
This portfolio showcases a selection of technical writing samples focused on clarity, usability, and audience-centered documentation. The work demonstrates my ability to translate complex information into clear, well-structured content for both technical and non-technical audiences. These samples reflect documentation practices commonly used in real product, support, and knowledge base environments.
## Writing Samples
The following samples demonstrate user-facing documentation, internal processes, and research translation.

## Approach
I approach technical writing as a problem-solving discipline. My focus is on understanding user goals, identifying points of friction, and presenting information in a way that is easy to scan, follow, and apply. I prioritize accuracy, consistency, and usability, with careful attention to information hierarchy and real-world user behavior.
